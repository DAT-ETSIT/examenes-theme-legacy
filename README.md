examenes-theme
==============

Custom theme for Apache's directory listing pages. Based on
[ramlmn/Apache-Directory-Listing](https://github.com/ramlmn/Apache-Directory-Listing).

The code used here makes the following assumptions:

  * There is a directory inside the server's root, called `/examenes`.
  * You're placing the contents of this repo inside it.

This is a very specific implementation with the right modifications to fit our
needs. If you want something similar you're probably looking for the
abovementioned repo.
